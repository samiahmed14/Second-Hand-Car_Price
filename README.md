# Second-Hand-Car-Price

**Project overview**

Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning is especially helpful when the vehicle is used and not coming direct from the factory. With increase in demand for used cars more and more vehicle buyers are finding alternatives of buying new cars. There is a need of accurate price prediction mechanism for the used cars. Prediction techniques of machine learning can be helpful in this regard.
